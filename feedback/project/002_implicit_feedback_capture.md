# Feedback: Implicit Feedback Capture

**Date**: 2026-01-01
**Source**: User chat
**Status**: **TRIAGED**

**Triaged to:**
- `AGENTS.md`: Added "Feedback Intuition" directive.

## Feedback
- The user should not have to explicitly say "this is feedback".
- If a message contains a suggestion, idea, demand, or new direction, I (Gemini) must treat it as feedback.
- This includes writing it down, triaging it to docs/TODOs/experiments.
- Goal: User can "type a thought and trust that I know what to do with it".

## Action Items
- [ ] Update `AGENTS.md` with a "Feedback Intuition" directive.
- [ ] Ensure I capture this specific feedback (recursive validation).
