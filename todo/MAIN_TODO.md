# Main TODO

## Infrastructure
- [ ] Initialize ChromaDB index for this repo (`scripts/build_index.py`)
- [ ] Set up `./project/` symlinks in `cyrus` and `string_theory_search`
- [ ] Create `scripts/setup_project.sh` for easy linking

## Knowledge Migration
- [ ] Absorb all notes from `cyrus` (if any)
- [ ] Absorb all notes from `lean_experiment`
- [ ] Review `research/` files and categorize into `prds/` or `design/` where appropriate

## Cyrus Development
- [ ] Implement Aeneas targets for `intersection.rs`
- [ ] Prove symmetry properties of intersection tensor
- [ ] Implement BBHL correction sign verification

## String Theory Search
- [ ] Integrate Cyrus as the primary physics engine
- [ ] Refactor meta-GA to use Cyrus-based evaluations
